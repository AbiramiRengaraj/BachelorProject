# 📌 Project Title:
Deep Learning for Dermoscopic Skin Lesion Classification using DenseNet

## 🧠 Overview:
This project applies deep learning to classify skin lesions from dermoscopic images using the DenseNet architecture. It aims to assist in early and accurate melanoma detection, reducing diagnostic subjectivity and improving accuracy compared to manual inspection.

## 🎯 Problem Statement:
Manual diagnosis of skin cancer through dermoscopy is subjective and error-prone. This project introduces a robust, automatic classification method using CNNs and transfer learning to detect and differentiate between 7 types of skin lesions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
Languages: Python

## Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV

## Techniques: CNN, DenseNet, Transfer Learning, Image Augmentation

## Tools: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset: ISIC 2018 Dataset (publicly available)

## 👨‍💻 My Role:
Led the model design and training using DenseNet architecture

Handled data preprocessing, augmentation, and optimization (Adam optimizer)

Conducted evaluation using classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

Participated in conference presentation of results

## 🖼️ Results:
Model successfully classified skin lesions into 7 types

Achieved promising accuracy and generalization performance on test data

Demonstrated practical value for computer-aided melanoma diagnosis
